# Gate Management and Guard Assignment System

This is a simple mobile application developed using React Native Expo for managing gates and assigning guards to those gates.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a simple application that includes a home page and several other pages for gate management and guard assignment.

## Features and Requirements

### Pages and Components:

1. **Gate Management:**
   - Add Gate Details
   - CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

2. **Guard Assignment:**
   - Assign Guards to Gates
   - Duplicate Assignment Check

3. **Home Page:**
   - Overview of the application with navigation options to Gate Management and Guard Assignment sections

### Deliverables:

1. Implement the above pages using React Native Expo.
2. Ensure forms are validated and provide user feedback on actions (e.g., successful addition, validation errors).
3. Use state management (like Redux or Context API) to handle the data flow within the app.
4. Ensure the UI is responsive and visually appealing.
